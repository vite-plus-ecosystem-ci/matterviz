  This runnable example adds deterministic charges, dipole arrows, density, a relaxed geometry
  and a six-frame trajectory to an unchanged input crystal in a Web Worker. Set a delay to try
  cancelling or restarting work, or enable failure to verify that the previous result remains
  available. No model download or server is needed.

<p>
  Import <code>structure_host_tool</code> and <code>StructureToolProps</code> from
  <code>matterviz/structure</code>
  (also exported from <code>matterviz</code>). Register your Svelte component before mounting
  viewers, and restore the registration when your host unmounts.
</p>
<pre><code
    >{`const run = start_run({
  model: 'my-model', version: '1.0',
  units: { charge: 'e', density: 'e/A^3' },
  settings: { seed: 0 },
})
const result = await predict(run.structure, { signal: run.signal })
run.on_overlay({
  result: { schema: 'my-model-result-v1', energy: result.energy },
  site_properties: result.site_properties,
  volumes: result.volumes, // each field needs a stable, unique id
  color_property: 'charge',
  geometry: { positions: result.positions, lattice: result.cell }, // optional
})`}</code
  ></pre>
<p>
  Each run receives a snapshot of its input; treat it as read-only. Each new run aborts the
  previous run. Its callbacks cannot change or clear newer results, and input changes or viewer
  unmounting invalidate it. Use <code>run.cancel()</code> to abort and clear,
  <code>run.clear()</code>
  to clear its outputs, and <code>run.on_view(null)</code> to return from a host view. Supply
  <code>show_host_tool: false</code> to nested structure viewers.
</p>
<p>
  Publish complete JSON-safe calculation data in <code>result</code> with a host-defined
  schema. The <code>prediction</code> prop includes imported results.
  <code>set_overlay_visible(false)</code> hides visuals while retaining results and surface
  settings;
  <code>run.on_overlay(null)</code> deletes the result. Overlays marked
  <code>transient: true</code> are live previews, e.g. each SCF step's density: they render,
  but the <code>prediction</code> prop and export pane skip them until the final result replaces
  them. Published after the result, a transient overlay previews other field values, e.g. an earlier
  SCF step, on the same surfaces while the result stays the prediction; publishing the result again
  ends the preview. Only the first field of a publication gets a default surface.
</p>
<p>
  <code>geometry</code> moves the drawn atoms, and with <code>lattice</code> the cell and
  supercell tiles, e.g. to follow a relaxation live: <code>positions</code> holds one Cartesian
  position in Å per input site, in input order, and <code>lattice</code> optional cell rows for
  periodic inputs. The input stays the run's identity, so the run, selections, edits and
  structure exports are unaffected, and volumes keep their own <code>lattice</code> and
  <code>origin</code>. Transient geometry is a preview like transient density; a result's
  geometry is exported with the prediction and shown again when it is reopened. A transient
  overlay after the result previews the geometry or fields it carries and keeps the result's
  others. Predicted geometry, like density, follows only the original cell.
  <code>run.replace_input(geometry)</code> adopts a result's geometry as the input in one undoable
  edit (undo in edit-atoms mode); the run stays current and its prediction is rebased onto the new
  input.
</p>
<p>
  Set <code>structure_host_tool.input_key</code> to select calculation inputs, including atom order.
  Unrelated annotations can then change without cancelling runs; replacing the document always cancels.
</p>
<p>
  Use the export pane to download the prediction JSON, including the captured input,
  properties, density grids and provenance, or export the original structure in the usual
  formats. Reuse a field ID only while its physical quantity, units and normalization stay
  compatible; change the ID when those semantics change. Labels, order and grid resolution can
  change without losing surface appearance, including extra or deliberately removed layers. <strong
    >Reset prediction surfaces</strong
  > restores defaults. Hidden-density notices offer direct cell and supercell recovery actions.
</p>

<p>
  Prediction metadata must contain plain JSON objects, arrays, strings, booleans, finite
  numbers or null. Undefined object fields are omitted. Convert Maps, Sets, Dates and typed
  arrays explicitly; unsupported values report their field path. Density values use
  Float64Array, are copied on publication, and must not be written concurrently while copying
  shared storage. Grid geometry is validated and cached statistics are recomputed.
</p>
<p>
  Drop an exported prediction JSON onto a Structure to reopen its input, properties, density
  and provenance. Hosts can also import <code>prediction_from_json</code> from
  <code>matterviz/structure</code> and pass its result as the viewer's <code>prediction</code>
  prop. Import accepts version 1 only and restores the original cell and 1×1×1 scaling.
</p>
<p>
  To measure larger grids locally, open <code>/test/isosurface-performance?size=128</code> and
  click <strong>Benchmark prediction</strong>. The page records three publication timings,
  export time and bytes, alongside the existing geometry/render timings and heap sampling.
