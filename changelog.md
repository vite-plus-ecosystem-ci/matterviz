- Expose the VS Code webview as a reusable `matterviz/file-viewer` module with host protocols, worker-safe parsing, transfer planning, automatic plot selection, and combined trajectory/DOS views https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/373

### 🛠 Enhancements

- Add multiline Treemap labels with hide/shrink/clip fitting, rotation, and anywidget zoom-root writeback; improve SVG export padding and plot overlay stability https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/373
- Harden large and compressed trajectory loading, embedded theme handling, plot pan/zoom bounds, stale reload behavior, and structure/treemap UI https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/374
- Add configurable volume-slice contours, Y flipping, synchronous rendering callbacks, bounded contour levels, and robust sampler-cache invalidation https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/400

## [v0.4.2](https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/compare/v0.4.1...v0.4.2)

> 9 July 2026

### 🚀 New Features

- Add zoomable `Treemap` hierarchical charts (squarified nested rectangles with click-to-zoom, breadcrumb pathbar, branch header strips, legend muting, metric coloring, and SVG/PNG export) sharing Sunburst tree semantics and data builders so switching charts is a one-line change https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Add VASP 6 HDF5 support: `vaspout.h5` trajectories (torn-file recovery, SCF pseudo-frames), electronic bands/DOS-only views, and `vaspwave` charge-density volumetrics, with VS Code webview routing for `vaspout_electronic` and `TrajectoryWithDos` https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Add `StructureCarousel` for browsable structure cards (virtualized WebGL mounts, keyboard/wheel paging, resizable track, portaled pager) plus a demo page https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Add opt-in `HeatmapTable` row virtualization with a `controls_target` portal for host-header search/export/settings https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372

### 🛠 Enhancements

- Fit-aware hierarchy labels: ordered fallback chain (`extended` → `label` → compact `label_short`), Sunburst font downscaling, and `auto` rotation that tries the other orientation before hiding text on narrow arcs/cells https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Smooth carousel scrolling by promoting entering cards to live WebGL canvases at most one per ~200ms mid-scroll (label shells first; remaining mounts on settle) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Harden HDF5 parsing against torn/corrupt files (keep frames before a bad trailing step as `dropped_steps`, constant-cell torch-sim normalization, vaspwave shape checks, gzipped `.traj` binary fast-path) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Fix stale `DraggablePane` viewport clamps (including legitimate `top: 0px`), HeatmapTable virtual-scroll/selection edge cases, carousel vertical page sizing, and bond-deletion e2e framing after `ensure_lattice_params` https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372

### 💡 Refactoring

- Deduplicate Sunburst/Treemap into shared `hierarchy-chart` helpers and a single `HierarchyControls` keyed by chart type; collapse duplicated sunburst/treemap settings into one factory https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372
- Split the VS Code webview parse path into worker-safe `parse.ts`, unify SCF frame metadata helpers, and trim carousel/table internals (opt-in virtualization, ID-indexed row selection) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/372

## [v0.4.1](https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

> 15 June 2026

### 🚀 New Features

- Render coordination polyhedra around cation-like centers in the 3D structure viewer — `compute_polyhedra` derives them from perceived bonds with PBC-aware neighbor expansion (closing correctly across cell boundaries), with `show_polyhedra`/opacity/edge/color-mode settings wired into `StructureControls` plus a demo page https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/358
- Make the anywidget bridge two-way reactive instead of fire-once: Python trait changes (incl. ipywidgets `link`) drive the live `Structure`/`Trajectory`/`ScatterPlot` view and component interaction writes back to Python, enabling coordinated multi-widget views https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/365
- Add generic categorical entry classification for convex-hull diagrams (2D/3D/4D) — shape-code entries by any categorical property (electronic class, crystallinity, magnetic ordering, ...) with a filter row of shape swatches, per-value counts, and show/hide toggles, plus a built-in magnetic-ordering preset https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/363
- Add symmetry-element overlays classifying operations into rotation/screw axes, mirror/glide planes, inversion centers, and rotoinversion axes (rendered by `SymmetryElements.svelte`) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/359

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fix moyo Wyckoff tables for non-conventional input cells: moyo's per-site arrays index the input cell (not `std_cell`), so sites are now grouped into crystallographic orbits with correct conventional-cell multiplicity (primitive FCC Cu now shows one `4a` instead of `1a` + 3 bogus letter-less rows) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/359
- Fix the homepage file picker dropping all crystal structures in production — the Rolldown build ignores `import: 'default'` in eager `import.meta.glob`, so a new `glob_text` helper normalizes module-namespace/parsed values back to raw text https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/360

### 💡 Refactoring

- Codebase-wide type-safety + naming cleanup (single-letter → snake_case, `[number, number]` → `Vec2`/`VecN`) and DRY extraction of shared plot/science helpers — net ~2,200 fewer lines across 247 files https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/360
- Extract shared 3D-scene (`SceneCamera`/`bind_renderer`), export-pane (`io/ExportPane.svelte`), and viewer-chrome (`layout/ViewerChrome.svelte`) modules across the Structure/Brillouin/FermiSurface/ChemPot/Trajectory viewers, plus parser hardening (106 files) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/361
- Follow-up dedup pass: `ConvexHullChrome.svelte` and `FullscreenButton.svelte` collapse copy-pasted toolbar/fullscreen code and a `create_chempot_overrides` factory dedupes the ChemPot control panes (~600 lines removed across 86 files) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/362
- Add tag-triggered publish CI: on a `v*.*.*` tag, gate on lint + tests + a version-match check, then publish `matterviz` and `matterviz-anywidget` to npm via OIDC trusted publishing and the VS Code extension to Open VSX (plus a `.vsix` artifact for the Marketplace) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/357

## [v0.4.0](https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/compare/v0.3.6...v0.4.0)

> 6 June 2026

### 🚀 New Features

- Add `BoxPlot` and `Violin` components (raw-data quantiles + Gaussian KDE, tukey/minmax/percentile/std whiskers, split/one-sided violins, `violin+box` overlay) and a `d3-sankey` flow diagram https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/349
- Add zoomable `Sunburst`/`Icicle` hierarchical charts (drill-down breadcrumbs, `value_mode`, `min_fraction` "Other" bucketing, metric coloring, SVG/PNG export) plus chem-system and spacegroup data builders https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/352
- Add `extensions/anywidget`: a self-contained ESM bundle published to npm as `matterviz-anywidget` for notebook/host runtimes (consumed by pymatviz) https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/351

### 🛠 Enhancements

- Rewrite fill-between to trace each boundary through its own `monotoneX` points (edges hug their lines), add fills to the legend with synced hover highlighting, and re-target `starry-night` syntax highlighting to `data-theme` https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/346
- Auto-detect format for extensionless `blob:` URLs via content/magic-byte sniffing, read gzip `Content-Encoding` responses binary-safe, and content-detect minified single-line JSON structures https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/355
- Keep `HeatmapTable` tooltips alive across sort/filter/pagination via a `MutationObserver`, and gzip large Brillouin-zone and XRD test fixtures https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/348
- Split chart content into z-ordered clip groups so reference lines interleave while annotations overflow, and cap/scroll overflowing legends https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/356

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fix correctness bugs across science kernels (XRD scattering prefactor + hkl bounds, `e_above_hull` for arity ≥ 5, gas corrections, moyo-wasm column-major rotations, RDF PBC, marching-cubes) and parsers (POSCAR/CIF/OPTIMADE, NPT XDATCAR, extxyz, composition), each with red→green regression tests https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/354
- Fix OPTIMADE element resolution, a convex-hull click-to-select page freeze (`effect_update_depth_exceeded`), fermi-surface upsampling/NaN crashes, violin KDE on log axes, and PBC-aware structure measurements https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/355
- Fix plot reactive update loops, clamp both ends of log domains to the positive floor (panning past zero stays recoverable), and gate y2 range write-back on actual y2-series presence https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/356
- Fix the fill `where` callback argument order and the reference-line `left`/`right` label side https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/346
- Unskip and triage ~75 Playwright tests, removing bit-rotted pixel-based suites and fixing the bugs they surfaced https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/350

### 💡 Refactoring

- Adopt the shared `@janosh/vite-config` oxlint ruleset, apply the resulting fixes across ~226 files (`to_error()` normalization, node-protocol imports, etc.), and migrate CI/tooling to pnpm on Node 24 https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/347
- Extend linting to the `extensions/` tree and fix the surfaced issues across the VS Code and Dash extensions https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/348
- Extract a reusable `ControlPane` and a crash-safe `unique_id()` helper shared across plot components https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/349
- Dedup plot interaction helpers: centralize tooltip constraining in `PlotTooltip`, extract `remove_drag_listeners`/`create_axis_loader`, and adopt screen-uniform pan-zoom https://github.com/janosh/matterviz/pull/356
