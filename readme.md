</h4>

`matterviz` is a toolkit for building interactive web UIs for materials science: 3D crystal structures, molecules, MD/relaxation trajectories, periodic tables, phase diagrams, convex hulls, spectral data (bands, DOS, IR/Raman), diffraction and pair distribution
functions (XRD, SAED, PDF/RDF), diffusion analysis (MSD), reaction paths (NEB), heatmaps,
and scatter plots.

## 🔨 &thinsp; Installation

```sh
npm add -D matterviz
```

## 📙 &thinsp; Usage

Spectral components accept keyed canonical collections: `<Bands band_structs={{ Si: bands }} />` and `<Dos doses={{ Si: dos }} />`. Bands declare `type: "phonon" | "electronic"`; DOS uses the same discriminator with `frequencies` or `energies`. Data is in THz for phonons and eV for electrons; a shared plot cannot mix the two types. `BandsAndDos` and `BrillouinBandsDos` own one bindable `units` prop for both panels (default `THz`); changing units resets frequency zoom to the converted shared range; nested `bands_props` and `dos_props` do not accept `units`. Electronic plots always use eV. Both paired viewers accept a shared `fermi_level` reference, including zero; omit it to use dataset metadata without modifying the input data. Parse external files once using `normalize_band_structure` or `normalize_dos`; extract projections with `extract_pdos(raw, "atom" | "orbital", filter)` before rendering. A single dataset still needs a key (`""` gives an unlabelled series).

Hull renderers expose `get_model()` (also `children`’s `model`) instead of writable `stable_entries`, `unstable_entries`, and `phase_stats` outputs. Pass that snapshot to `<ConvexHullStats {model} />`, or call `compute_hull_model(entries, options)` for headless computation. The numerical model is independent of display thresholds and category styles. `model.facets` contains vertex indices into the single enriched `model.entries` table, so geometry and stability always refer to the same entries.

Composite components expose deliberate `*_props` options for presentation and interactions. Their parent owns data and synchronization: use `band_structs`, `doses`, or `trajectory` on the parent rather than supplying replacement child data. Plot `series` are read-only inputs; bind `hidden_series` for legend choices and `view` for zoom. Supply stable `id` values when reordering series or persisting visibility; omitted IDs use array positions. Multiple drawing series can share a `legend_id` for one legend entry and visibility choice; their drawing IDs must remain unique, and `hidden_series` then uses the shared `legend_id`. Bands uses `JSON.stringify([material_key, spin])` for these keys (`spin` is `up` or `down`; use material key `""` for an unlabelled dataset). Composite wrappers accept `hidden_series` plus `on_hidden_series_change` for controlled visibility. Legend callbacks run after the chart updates visibility. Axis identifiers are `x`, `x2`, `y`, and `y2`; `on_axis_change` delegates loading to the caller. `create_axis_loader` cancels superseded requests independently per axis; `cancel()` aborts all pending axes.

`HeatmapTable` columns have stable `id` values and optional `key` accessors and `cell` snippets; labels only control headings. Selectable tables require `row_key` and bind `selected_ids`, so replacing rows with fresh objects preserves selection.

### Periodic Table

```svelte
<script>
  import { PeriodicTable } from 'matterviz'

  const heatmap_values = { H: 10, He: 4, Li: 8, Fe: 3, O: 24 }
</script>

<PeriodicTable {heatmap_values} />
```

### Structure

```svelte
<script>
  import { Structure } from 'matterviz'
  const source = '/structures/TiO2.cif'
  // supports .cif, .poscar, .xyz/.extxyz, pymatgen JSON, OPTIMADE JSON, .gz
</script>

<Structure {source} style="width: 500px; aspect-ratio: 1" />
```

`scene_props.camera_position` fits the structure when omitted; any supplied coordinate tuple, including `[0, 0, 0]`, is an explicit position. Clear it with `undefined` to request a fresh fit.

Floating viewer, plot, table and heatmap controls share `show_controls`: `true`/`'always'`, `'hover'`, `false`/`'never'`, or `{ mode, hidden, style }`. For example, `{ mode: 'hover', hidden: ['controls'] }` keeps a plot’s fullscreen button and hides its settings pane. `false` hides all plot chrome; `controls_open` independently controls whether the settings pane is open.

`Structure` accepts parsed data through `structure`, or a URL, `File` or `{ data, filename }` payload through `source`, and handles file drops. Set `allow_file_drop={false}` when a parent owns loading. Its `scene_props` accepts `StructureSettings`; computed results are available through the readonly `analysis` export on a component reference. Loading delegates to the same `open_material()` runtime available to non-component hosts, so fetching, decompression, format detection, workers, provenance, and disposal remain centralized. Prediction JSON files reopen with their input, properties, density and provenance; hosts can also pass `prediction_from_json(content)` as the `prediction` prop. Selection, measurements, atom/bond editing with undo/redo and the supercell/image-atom pipeline live in a headless `StructureSession` (exported from `matterviz/structure`); `active_pane: 'controls' | 'info' | 'export' | null` identifies the open floating pane.

Host computations register a component through `structure_host_tool` from `matterviz/structure`. Each run captures its input and exposes an abort signal plus guarded publication callbacks. Publish complete, versioned JSON-safe calculation metadata through `StructureToolOverlay.result`; the host receives accepted and reopened snapshots through its `prediction` prop. Use `set_overlay_visible()` to toggle predicted properties and density without discarding results or edited surfaces. Mark live previews (e.g. an unconverged density) `transient: true`: they render like a prediction and hand their surfaces to the final result's same-ID volumes, but never reach the host's `prediction` prop, the export pane or JSON. An optional `geometry: { positions, lattice? }` (Cartesian positions in Å per input site, in input order, plus optional cell rows) moves the drawn atoms and cell, e.g. to follow a relaxation live, while the input stays the run's identity: runs, selections, edits and structure exports keep addressing it, and volumes render in their own `lattice`. A result's geometry is exported with the prediction and shown again on reopening; transient geometry never is. `run.replace_input(geometry)` adopts such a geometry (e.g. a relaxed structure) as the viewer's input in one undoable edit: the run stays current and its prediction is rebased onto the new input, keeping its fields, surfaces and site properties; undoing the edit restores the previous input and clears the run's output. A transient overlay published after its run's result previews the field values or geometry it carries (e.g. an earlier SCF or relaxation step) while the result stays the prediction and keeps everything the preview omits; publishing the result again ends the preview. A preview that leaves out an owned field hides it, and the field's surfaces return with their settings when the run publishes it again. A publication draws one default surface, for its first field; further fields are listed in the isosurface controls without a surface. Set `signed: false` on a volume that is non-negative by nature (e.g. a total charge density whose small negative values are numerical artifacts) so its default surface skips the negative lobe, or `signed: true` to show it from the start; unset infers it from the data. An optional `structure_host_tool.input_key` selects relevant in-place calculation inputs, including atom order; document replacement still invalidates ownership. See the [host-tool demo](https://matterviz.janosh.dev/structure/host-tool).

Every `VolumetricData` has a nonempty, unique `id`. Isosurface layers require `volume_id` and optionally `color_volume_id`; `active_volume_id` selects the slice field. Keep IDs stable when replacing or reordering fields so selection and surface settings follow the data. Removing a field drops its surfaces and clears color references to it. File loading derives IDs from the source filename and field identity; host predictions use the same `id` contract. A volume’s `origin` is an offset in the structure’s Cartesian frame; cube parsing translates atoms and the grid together into that frame. File imports combine fields only when the nonempty ordered atoms, species, occupancies, coordinates, and lattice match (Cartesian coordinates and lattice vectors use an absolute tolerance below `1e-8 A`; species and occupancies match exactly); otherwise they replace the scene and its fields.

### Composition

```svelte
<script>
  import { Composition } from 'matterviz'
  // modes can be 'pie' (default) | 'bubble' | 'bar'
</script>

<Composition composition="LiFePO4" mode="pie" />
```

`Structure`, `Trajectory`, `BrillouinZone` and `FermiSurface` share the `source` input for URLs, files and named payloads. `ConvexHull` accepts `entries` and automatically chooses a binary, ternary or quaternary plot. The dimension-specific renderers and `StructureBarPlot` are internal; use `BondAnglePlot`, `CoordinationBarPlot` or `StructureTypePlot` for structure distributions.

### Trajectory

```svelte
<script>
  import { Trajectory } from 'matterviz'
  // supports .xyz/.extxyz, .traj, .hdf5, .npz, .pkl, .dat plus .gz/.zip wrappers;
  // decompress .bz2/.xz first because browsers cannot decode them
</script>

<Trajectory source="/traj/ase-md.xyz" auto_play fps={10} style="max-height: 700px" />
```

`Trajectory.visible_properties` is the shared selection for scatter and histogram modes. It contains exact source property keys, independently of display labels; an empty array hides every series. Legend clicks, isolation, and plot-mode changes use this same state.

**Analysis → Thermal hotspots** maps regional kinetic energy over a selected frame window. Use velocities with masses, or stored kinetic energy with its units and reference. The pane reads declared mass/velocity units and infers missing mass units from recorded masses; verify these defaults and supply any missing units. Choose a stationary device, center-of-mass removal for selected atoms inside the grid, or per-bin center-of-mass removal. The map is an atom-exposure average (integrated energy divided by integrated population), not a persistence statistic. Recorded timestamps determine trapezoidal weights when available; otherwise MD steps do. Empty and undersampled bins are transparent. Kelvin requires suitable translational degrees of freedom; stored energies require an explicit post-reference value.

Large fixed-topology MD HDF5 (`md-trajectory-v1`), TorchSim HDF5, and ASE ULM trajectories provide bounded numeric atom reads for thermal analysis. Local files opened by the viewer calculate in the file-owning worker and support cancellation, a selected-frame preview, and progressive time averages. Cell-following and fixed-device grids support triclinic cells and per-axis periodicity. Atoms remain visible throughout playback, with optional heatmap coloring and a translucent volume cloud with configurable colors and opacity. Threshold and display changes reuse the calculated map; analysis changes require recalculation. `run.compute_hotspots(options)` exposes the calculation programmatically; atom batches stay internal to the readers and reducer. The default 128 MiB budget reserves analysis buffers, retained maps, decoder and display buffers; it is not a total browser/GPU memory limit. HDF5 storage chunks above 8 MiB are rejected and must be rechunked. Large text and Reference MD readers do not yet provide this bounded numeric path.

`Trajectory` accepts a URL, `File` or `{ data, filename }` through `source`, handles drops and HDF5 group selection, and disposes runs it opens. To manage data yourself, pass a `TrajectoryRun` through `trajectory` and dispose it yourself; the viewer borrows supplied runs. Use `trajectory_from_frames(frames)` for existing frames or `open_trajectory(bytes, { filename })` for same-thread parsing. Set `allow_file_drop={false}` when the parent owns loading. Disposed runs reject every frame read, including frame zero; `run.preview` remains accessible.

`run.read_frame()` returns a `NumericFrame` with source-precision coordinate buffers and a separate `header` for step, time, and metadata. These snapshots are read-only: do not mutate or transfer their buffers. Pass `{ vectors: [] }` as the third argument to request coordinates without vector channels, or list the vector keys you need. Use `materialize_frame(await run.read_frame(frame_idx))` when you need editable `TrajectoryFrame` objects with `structure.sites`.

Trajectory event callbacks also receive numeric frames. Prepared playback frames use coordinates wrapped for display; read the frame through `run.read_frame()` when you need the original source coordinates.

#### Scripted camera movies

`Trajectory.on_controller` exposes an awaitable `load(source, { hdf5_group_path, signal })`, `prepare_frame(idx)`, `inspect()`, `plan_movie(request)`, `render_movie(plan, on_frame, { signal, on_progress })`, `export_movie(plan, options)` and `cancel_movie()`. Loading resolves after the first scene is rendered; inspection returns atom/frame counts, displayed atom bounds and the interactive camera, which is separate from the export camera. Keep a structure-containing display mode selected. Each render restores the original frame and playback state, including cancellation. `render_movie` calls `on_frame(canvas, idx, signal)` with one reusable canvas at a time: inspect or consume its pixels before resolving your callback, and stop consuming it when the signal aborts. Cancellation releases the viewer even when a consumer remains pending. `movie_frame(plan, idx)` supplies the source-frame index and microsecond timestamp. Source frames are held or skipped to fit the requested duration; atomic coordinates are not interpolated.

From a repository checkout with Playwright Chromium and FFmpeg installed, run:

```sh
pnpm movie inspect /path/to/trajectory.h5
pnpm movie preview movie.json --output storyboard.png
pnpm movie render movie.json --output movie.mp4
```

The CLI starts a private local viewer automatically; `--url http://localhost:3000` uses an existing server. Its dedicated `/trajectory/render` page exposes the same controller as `window.matterviz_movie`, plus `configure(structure_props)`. Files selected through `#movie-source` stay browser `File` objects, so indexed HDF5 loading does not copy an entire large file into JavaScript memory. Results are JSON on stdout; progress and errors go to stderr. Ctrl+C cancels the job. Existing output files are never overwritten.

From another directory, invoke `node /path/to/matterviz/src/scripts/movie.mjs render movie.json --output movie.mp4`. The private viewer starts from the checkout while the input JSON and output keep their caller-relative paths. `visuals.cutaway` accepts the same cutaway settings as `Structure`; use a slice when a dense bulk system would obscure the motion.

```json
{
  "source": { "path": "./trajectory.h5" },
  "camera": {
    "preset": "orbit",
    "turns": 0.75,
    "elevation_deg": 25,
    "azimuth_deg": 35,
    "distance_scale": 1.1,
    "up": [0, 0, 1]
  },
  "visuals": {
    "color_scheme": "Jmol",
    "scene_props": { "show_bonds": "never", "gizmo": false }
  },
  "video": {
    "width": 1920,
    "height": 1080,
    "duration_s": 12,
    "fps": 30,
    "background": "#111827",
    "codec": "h264",
    "crf": 18,
    "preset": "slow"
  }
}
```

Local source paths resolve relative to the JSON file; a `source.url` or `source.hdf5_group_path` can also be supplied. Omit `frames` to cover the whole trajectory or provide `{ "start": 0, "end": 100 }` with an exclusive end. Omit `camera` to hold the fitted view, use the orbit preset, or provide an explicit `CameraFlight` with timed keyframes. Orbit fitting starts from the current frame; inspect a storyboard for expanding cells or moving atoms before committing to a long render. A completed job saves the resolved camera path, reference viewport and encoding settings beside the output as `<output>.json`; edit its FPS or duration and render it again to produce a new frame schedule while retaining camera framing.

For irregular simulation timestamps, provide `source_frames` with one zero-based source index per encoded video frame. Indices must lie within the selected `frames` range; repeated indices hold actual recorded coordinates. The array length must equal `round(video.duration_s * video.fps)`, so editing the duration or FPS of an explicit schedule requires updating the schedule too. Previews sample the same schedule, and the saved plan records it for reproducible offline rendering.

During rendering, `<output>.review/plan.json` records the plan and `<output>.review/latest.png` is atomically replaced with sampled frames from the actual encoder input. JSON `sample` events identify the image path, video frame, source frame and timestamp. Inspect that image while the command runs; Ctrl+C or SIGTERM cancels a bad render. `encoding` and `verifying` events distinguish finalization from validation. The final `<output>.review/storyboard.png` is decoded from the encoded video, and validation checks decoding errors, frame count, dimensions and duration. Review artifacts remain available after cancellation or failure. `--samples` controls the sample count for previews and render inspection (default six). Output, manifest and review-path collisions are rejected before loading.

The offline CLI encodes exact frame timestamps through FFmpeg, supports H.264, VP9 and AV1, and accepts `video.bitrate` in bits/s instead of `video.crf`. Pixel dimensions are exact and independent of device pixel ratio. Browser `export_movie` and the export pane use the same frame producer with AV1 MediaRecorder encoding: their elapsed duration can grow with slow frame reads. For exact timing, use the offline CLI. Video captures the 3D canvas; DOM legends, plots and floating controls are not included.
